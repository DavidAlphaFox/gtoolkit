!Transcript

The GT Transcript offers a rich and interactive interface for displaying live information coming from a system. Text is only the beginning!

!!The API

The API is backward compatible with the existing transcript. To enable the new features, we introduced a builder. For example, ==transcript nextPutAll: 'something'== becomes ==transcript next putAll: 'something'==. Between `next` and `putAll:`, we can add multiple attributes to the text output.

The following example shows the complete API.

!!Logging an animation

To get an idea of how this tool could be useful, take a look at the following example. A Bloc animation is logged in a visual, domain centric way, providing insight far superior to plain text.
