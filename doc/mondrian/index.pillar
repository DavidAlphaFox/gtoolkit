!MondrianMondrian is an engine for graph-based visualization. Its roots date back to 2005 and it had multiple incarnations since then, including the ones from Roassal. The current version is based on Bloc, the new graphical engine for Pharo. The current version makes extensive use of Bloc and its mechanisms. And the result is that it requires a very short implementation that is specific to visualizing graphs. It turns out that most of the things we need for graphs are actually generic concepts that can be used for all sorts of other graphical needs.But enough talk. To get an idea of what Mondrian is about, let's consider some examples. 
!!A few examplesThe first example shows a tree made of nodes and interconnecting edges that are organized as a radial tree. Except that there are also two red edges that do not affect the layout.[[[example=GtMondrianBasicExamples>>#passiveEdgesOn:|expanded=true|noCode=true|show=gtLiveIn:]]]Another one shows a UML-like visualization of a class hierarchy.[[[example=GtMondrianDomainExamples>>#umlClassesOn:|expanded=true|noCode=true|show=gtLiveIn:]]]Each of these examples are similar in that they are constructed as transformations of some input data into pictures. Yet, the transformation is different: - One shows a tree with nodes represented as rectangles. Another one shows nodes represented as UML class elements. - One shows only simple nodes. Another one also shows nested nodes.- Most drawn edges affect the visualization, except for two red ones that even if thicker they are passive ones.!!A tutorialThe most basic parts of a Mondrian view are:# Nodes# Edges# LayoutLet's see how we create these. First the nodes.[[[example=GtMondrianBasicExamples>>#twoNodesOn:|expanded=true|show=gtLiveIn:]]]Given those nodes, we can build edges.[[[example=GtMondrianBasicExamples>>#oneEdgeBetweenTwoNodesOn:|expanded=true|show=gtLiveIn:]]]And finally, we lay them out.[[[example=GtMondrianBasicExamples>>#layoutOnOneEdgeBetweenTwoNodesOn:|expanded=true|show=gtLiveIn:]]]
